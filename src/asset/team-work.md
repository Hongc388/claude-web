### Manage CLAUDE.md for large teams

For organizations deploying Claude Code across teams, you can centralize instructions and control which CLAUDE.md files are loaded.

#### Deploy organization-wide CLAUDE.md

Organizations can deploy a centrally managed CLAUDE.md that applies to all users on a machine. This file cannot be excluded by individual settings.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the file at the managed policy location">
    * macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/CLAUDE.md`
    * Linux and WSL: `/etc/claude-code/CLAUDE.md`
    * Windows: `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\CLAUDE.md`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy with your configuration management system">
    Use MDM, Group Policy, Ansible, or similar tools to distribute the file across developer machines. See [managed settings](/en/permissions#managed-settings) for other organization-wide configuration options.
  </Step>
</Steps>

A managed CLAUDE.md and [managed settings](/en/settings#settings-files) serve different purposes. Use settings for technical enforcement and CLAUDE.md for behavioral guidance:

| Concern                                        | Configure in                                              |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| Block specific tools, commands, or file paths  | Managed settings: `permissions.deny`                      |
| Enforce sandbox isolation                      | Managed settings: `sandbox.enabled`                       |
| Environment variables and API provider routing | Managed settings: `env`                                   |
| Authentication method and organization lock    | Managed settings: `forceLoginMethod`, `forceLoginOrgUUID` |
| Code style and quality guidelines              | Managed CLAUDE.md                                         |
| Data handling and compliance reminders         | Managed CLAUDE.md                                         |
| Behavioral instructions for Claude             | Managed CLAUDE.md                                         |

Settings rules are enforced by the client regardless of what Claude decides to do. CLAUDE.md instructions shape Claude's behavior but are not a hard enforcement layer.
